# Assignment 4: Interactive Visualization System

For this assignment, you will implement a system that integrates interactive visualizations with advanced data analytics methods (e.g., ML and NLP) for exploring a complex dataset of your choice. You should work in __teams of 2 students__ for this assignment.


## Requirement
The interactive visualization system to be implemented must incorporate at least one of the following data analytics methods:

* Dimensionality reduction
* Clustering
* Factor analysis
* Natural language processing

You should choose the proper data analytics method(s) based on your dataset.

For visualization, the system needs to have a dashboard consisting 3 linked views, including both an overview and detail view of the analysis results. Similar to Assignment 2, one of the views must be using an advanced visualization method (i.e., it cannot be a scatter plot, bar chart, pie chart or other similar basic plots).

In addition, the dashboard needs to have two types of user interaction:

* __Interaction Type 1__: Widgets for configuring/adjusting the parameters of the data analytics method
* __Interaction Type 2__: Selection of items in the overview for displaying extra information about the selected items in the detail view. The interaction for selection can be mouse click, mouse over, zooming, or lasso selection.

For example, if K-Means clustering is used for analyzing a multidimensional dataset, the dashboard should have a widget for users to control the value of _k_ (the number of clusters should be in the result), and the clustering results can be displayed in the overview visualization with a lasso selection (see an [example](https://bl.ocks.org/skokenes/a85800be6d89c76c1ca98493ae777572) here).


For system implementation, you can use either JavaScript or Python. You can also use a server-client architecture for implementing the system, which you can Javascript for the visualization frontend and Python for the server backend.

## Resource

You can select a dataset from the list below or use any other dataset that you want:

## Submission
To submit, push all your source codes to the forked repository you used for Assignment 1 and 3. For this assignment, you do not need to create a pull request. Instead, submit the hyperlink to your repository in UCD Canvas. After submission, some of the teams will be selected to present their work in class. For other teams that are not selected, an online signup sheet will be provided for selecting a time to present their work to the TA for grading.  Please be prepared to answer questions about the tasks you did for this assignment, which is listed below with the grading breakdown

* Data Analysis Method (30 pts)
* Overview Visualization (10 pts)
* Detailed Visualization (10 pts)
* Third Visualization (10 pts) - Either an additional overview or detail, or another linked view.
* System Design and Interactions (40 pts)
  * Selecting data points within the overview
  * Views are linked together
  * Application of data analysis method makes sense
  * System design makes sense
